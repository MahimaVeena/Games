          Hello there! I'm Mahima, hailing from the vibrant state of Karnataka.
          My journey in the tech world began after completing my engineering
          degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). I am a back
          end developer with 3+ years of experience. I have joined Wissen on 5th
          Feb 2024.

          Recently, I embarked on an exciting project to build a website from
          the ground up. This endeavor was not just a test of my coding
          abilities but also a significant leap towards enhancing my front-end
          development skills. Thank you for taking the time to learn about my
          journey.
